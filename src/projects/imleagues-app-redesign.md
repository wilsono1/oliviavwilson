Role: UX Researcher and Designer, Solo Project\
Duration: 2 weeks\
\
**Case Study Overview**\
\
The IMLeagues app is a widely used tool on college campuses for booking fitness classes and managing intramural sports. Like many students, I often use this app to reserve spots in workout classes, check gym schedules, and receive notifications about weather-related cancellations. However, IMLeagues is plagued by issues such as poor navigation, unnecessary complexity, and an outdated interface, which have earned it a notoriously poor reputation.\
\
**What made me choose IMLeagues for the redesign?**\
\
The inspiration for the redesign stems from my personal experience and the feedback from friends and schoolmates. After using the app consistently for four years, I've found the experience to be anything but smooth. My goal is to use my design skills to revamp the user experience, giving IMLeagues a well-deserved upgrade after its troubling existence during my college years.\
\
**The Challenge**

To revise the IMLeagues app, my goal is to address usability issues, create a seamless user experience, and deliver a polished UI.\
\
For this redesign, I'm adopting a heuristic approach to identify the main issues with the app. While the app serves its purpose, it fails to stand out among other booking apps due to its poor interface and navigation.\
\
I’m taking an upward approach, starting with the current user experience and identifying problems, to working on the user flows, low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity prototyping, and usability testing.\
\
**Online Feedback**\
\
Online reviews for the IMLeagues app on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store are predominantly negative. Users frequently cite several issues, including an overwhelming number of ads, significant lag and bugs, and a poorly designed user interface.\
\
**Analyzing the Problems**\
\
The main problems illustrated from the user feedback and analysis.\
\
*The navigation needs reorganizing, prioritizing a simple user experience for the everyday fitness class users:*\
\
The main users of the app are intramural sports participants, fitness class attendees, and casual gym-goers. Based on my interviews and surveys, fitness class attendees and casual gym-goers face the most issues. Their primary frustration stems from the overly complex navigation when signing up for classes and finding gym hours.\
\
*Important features are not highlighted:*\
\
Key features such as class bookings, gym hours, and QR code login are not optimally highlighted, making it difficult to engage everyday users effectively.\
\
\
**Specific weaknesses**

\
-The side tab is redundant and unnecessary. \
-Integrating intramural information into the general user space confuses non-intramural users. \
-The QR code login is hidden within the profile page, making it difficult to access from the main navigation.\
-The pages look very similar and lack strong visual cues, making it hard for users to distinguish their location and complete tasks successfully.\
\
\
**Key Takeaways**\
\
*Flexibility and efficiency of use:*\
\
The navigation is unnecessarily complicated for everyday users, but there are opportunities to simplify the interface, and allow novice users to become more experienced and personalize the interface more.\
\
*The current interface is outdated:*\
\
The IMLeagues app primarily targets college students. However, its interface lacks the modern look and visual appeal that users expect from trending designs.\
\
*The intramural functions are not an issue:*\
\
Based on user feedback, the intramural functions could benefit from some reorganization, but overall, these features work well for users. While a visual update might enhance the app's appeal, it's crucial to preserve the elements that are already effective.\
\
\
**User Experience Research: Surveys, Interviews, and Existing App Analysis**

I distributed a short survey to as many app users as possible to identify its primary issues. The survey focused on users' likes, dislikes, and overall ratings of the app. I then displayed the most relevant and popular responses in diagrams below. For the app improvements, I sorted them by popularity and importance, prioritizing the most common themes to address the most pressing issues. The app was rated a 2.71 out of 5. My goal is to have a have a higher rating at the end of the redesign.

\
\
I conducted several user interviews to understand why the navigation is so confusing and to gather suggestions for improving the user experience for those taking classes and using the gym. Through these interviews, I received direct feedback on their preferences for navigation, including the placement of upcoming classes, gym hours, and the QR scan-in feature.\
\
*If I have more time:*\
\
Interestingly, users participating in intramural sports were satisfied with the current features. Since intramural management is a key aspect of the app, I would like to explore innovative ways to enhance the user experience in this area when I have more time. However, given my time constraints for this solo project, I will focus on revising the visual aesthetics to ensure the intramural features remain effective and enjoyable.\
\
\
**Existing App Analysis**\
\
I conducted a heuristic analysis audit on the IMLeagues app, as well as other booking and gym-related apps like TechnoGym, Orange Theory, and Club Pilates. This process was extremely insightful, revealing various standout features that could enhance the IMLeagues app's engagement. Observing the placement and trends of certain features, such as the QR code scan location, provided valuable insights from user-tested, deployed products. Leveraging my background knowledge of Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, I took detailed notes and identified strong features that could be incorporated into IMLeagues.

1. Visibility of Status: Class occupancy is indicated by a colored ring—red for full classes and green for those with available space.\
2. Enrollment and Capacity: The number of participants is shown alongside the total capacity of the class.\
3. Class Descriptions and Instructors: Each class provides details about the instructor and a description of the class, offering users valuable background information.\
4. Class History: The history of specific classes is displayed on their respective pages. However, it might be more beneficial to show your personal class history.

*Key positive features of TechnoGym to consider for the redesign (Personal Favorite):*

1. Call to Action on the Home Page: A widget encouraging engagement with specific features\
2. QR Code: The QR code scanner is placed consistently with Club Pilates, possibly an industry standard placement.\
3. Class Booking: The "Book a Class" button on the landing page provides a shortcut for booking classes. Displaying favorite classes for quick booking could enhance flexibility for advanced users.\
4. AI Workout Creator/Workout Creator: While not a priority due to limited time, this feature is very appealing and could be added later. User testing might reveal if it's too different too soon. Prioritizing other changes first and then adding this feature could be beneficial.\
5. Polished UI: The user interface is clean, polished, engaging, and up-to-date.\
   Imagery throughout the App: Including images of different classes and events gives users a quick visual reference.\
6. Class Duration Time: Users might appreciate knowing the length of each class.\
7. Sorting by Class Time: This could be a useful filter for students looking for classes that fit their school schedules.\
8. Save to Calendar Popup: This popup allows users to save bookings to their phone calendars.\
   Calendar Page: The app currently lacks a calendar page for classes and events. Instead, upcoming events are displayed on the landing page. A/B testing could help determine the best approach.\
9. Movergy Feature: While the "Movergy" feature is interesting, stats about class history or intramural participation might be more appealing. The video introduction to this feature is captivating and engaging.\
10. Accessibility: The use of bold fonts, labeling with icons, and color contrast promotes accessible use.\
    \
    *Key positive features of Club Pilates App to consider for the redesign:*

![Club Pilates App Audit ](/src/assets/img/screenshot-2025-02-24-at-4.01.04 pm.png "Club Pilates App Audit ")

\

1. Calendar Page: The calendar page displays upcoming bookings. I like this layout, but I'm unsure if it's better or worse than displaying upcoming events. I'd like to A/B test this.\
2. Goals: The goals are easy to track since they're based on classes. This might be simpler than the "Movergy" concept.\
3. Milestones: The reward badges are depicted as milestones, which I find clearer and more motivating compared to other visual rewards like trophies.\
4. Attendance: This feature is great for viewing your class history. It's very clear.\
   \
   *Key positive features of Orange Theory App to consider for the redesign:*
