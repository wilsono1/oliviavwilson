## Introduction:

Role: UX Researcher and Designer

Project Timeline: Sept 2024-May 2025 (2 academic semesters) 



## Problem Statement: 

Inspired by witnessing burnout symptoms in my mother and friends who are nurses, I set out to design a digital solution to help clinical staff alleviate burnout. My goal was to explore how gratitude recognition could play a role in addressing this issue.



### Solution: 

<Visual of Final Project>



Partnering with Valley Hospital in Paramus, I collaborated with a floor of over 40 nurses and clinical staff to redesign their existing digital gratitude recognition platform, the Be the Key System, tailoring the redesign to their specific needs. Improving the system for better usability, visual appeal, and impact. 



### Timeline:  

<Visual Timeline> 



Sept. 2024-December 2024: Background Research, Meeting the Team, Developing a Research Plan. 



December 2024-January 2025: Initial Surveys and Interviews, Creating the In-person Initiative (Observational Research), Analyzing key findings, creating personas, user journeys, card sorting, and establishing information architecture. 



February 2025: Creating lo-fi wireframing, and ideating various mid-fidelity wireframes with AI (Replit) assistance. Creating variations of the platform for early stage A/B testing. Conducted user testing with 30+ nurses over Microsoft Teams using polls. 



## Background Research: 



### Clinical Burnout: 



Hospital nurses perform difficult and stressful tasks, often with smiles on their faces. The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory highlights factors contributing to burnout among health workers, with 35-54% of nurses and physicians experiencing burnout. The 2024 NSI National HealthCare Retention & RN Staffing Report shows an average RN turnover rate of 18.4%, costing hospitals an average of $4.82M annually. Supporting nurses' well-being through gratitude practices, such as notes, monetary rewards, and organizational support, can significantly reduce burnout and improve retention. Encouraging gratitude from leadership to caregivers and patients creates a positive atmosphere, enhancing nurses' ability to serve and reducing turnover rates.

### Existing Services: 



I analyzed digital gratitude recognition platforms such as Wambi, KudoBoard, and Gusto, as well as the Daisy Foundation, to gain a deeper understanding of existing gratitude services. Additionally, I examined the Valley Hospital's "Be the Key" digital gratitude recognition system to understand its layout and functionality. This system served as a framework for my research since the nurses were already familiar with it.

Background information on the "Be the Key" system: "Keys" are certificates containing a gratitude story shared between teammates. Managers approve and send out these "Keys" via email. The "Be the Key" system is a digital platform where staff can write, view, and redeem keys. When staff redeem keys, they are sent to HR for approval, and eventually, the staff receive a voucher for an external platform with virtual gift card redemptions.



### On-site Research:



The Gratitude Initiative at The Valley Hospital: 



To support my research on how gratitude and public recognition impact nurses' wellbeing, I volunteered at Valley Hospital in Paramus, NJ. After back and forth discussions with the floor manager and experience coordinator, we developed a gratitude initiative that integrated the existing digital "Be the Key" system with a public recognition board to evaluate the role of public recognition in a digital system. My role in the process involves receiving key messages from managers, creating gratitude cards, and displaying them on the board.



The process is illustrated below:



<User Journey> 



\*\*\*\*Trial and Error: The initial ideation stages for the observational research were hectic. Inspired by various wellness apps and programs, I sketched multiple public recognition and gratitude initiative ideas that integrated wellness goals and tasks. It was valuable to learn how nurses engage with any system. Given their limited time and frequent exhaustion, simplicity was key. Making the initiative as convenient as possible for them was essential.

#### On-Site Research Conditions: 

For this research, I had the privilege of working with over 40 clinical staff members, primarily nurses, along with other hospital personnel. Participation was entirely voluntary and supervised by the floor manager and experience coordinator. I was incredibly grateful for their cooperation and positive attitude towards this project.

#### Research Goals: 

My research goals for this project was:



* To gain a comprehensive understanding of clinical burnout and the daily experiences of hospital nurses.
* To develop a gratitude initiative aimed at enhancing the well-being of hardworking clinical staff who frequently experience burnout, and to explore the integration of public recognition into their current digital system.
* To identify the strengths and weaknesses of their existing digital gratitude system, known as the Be the Key system.



Research Challenges and Thoughts:



The research was the highlight of this journey for me. I thoroughly enjoyed problem-solving at every step, experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions as I navigated this independent project. When I decided to conduct a UX project focused on nurses, I knew I wanted authentic research data. Although I wasn't certain what the final product would be, I was committed to involving the nurses in the decision-making process. Convincing the hospital to allow me to undertake this initiative and study the nurses was crucial to the project's success. I felt a strong responsibility to meet the expectations of the nurses, leadership, and staff. Despite the nerve-wracking moments, this challenge pushed me to rise to the occasion and do whatever it took to successfully complete the research phase of the project.



Key Research Takeaways: 



### Redesigning the Be the Key System

Enhancing the existing digital gratitude system aligns well with the project's timeline and scope, leveraging the nurses' familiarity and success with the current system.

### Identifying Problems in the Be the Key System

Feedback from nurses, managers, and staff highlighted several issues that could be addressed in the redesign:

* Lack of notifications for expiring keys
* Long wait times for receiving gift card vouchers
* Outdated interface and lack of visual cues
* Lengthy process for managers to approve and send out keys
* Supporting meaningful recognition over the quantity of recognition

### Integrating Recognition into the Digital System

The idea of a public recognition board and the integration of visual recognition into the digital system was positively received by the nurses.



Research Methodologies: 



The primary research methods included interviews, surveys, and observation. On December 11th, I launched the initiative by setting up the gratitude board in the team's room and sending an email to the nurses and staff explaining the project and including a survey about their existing digital gratitude service, the "Be the Key" system.

Observational Research: 



\-QR Codes and a Mobile version



I was curious to see if nurses would prefer a mobile platform for the digital gratitude system, given they use iPhones for daily tasks. To test this, I created a Microsoft form to simulate the key submission form and placed a QR code on the board with instructions. Initially, there was one response, but by the third week, a nurse informed me the QR code was broken. I quickly replaced it with a non-expiring QR code and updated all promotional posters. Despite this, only two people used the form compared to 29 notes on the board from the key system. This confirmed that a mobile version was unnecessary for this redesign. It highlighted the value of gift cards and the nurses' familiarity with the existing system, which is integrated into their desktop work routine.

\-Posters and Familiarity



I was interested in creating awareness about the key system. For the initial launch, I made posters to engage the nurses and staff. Unsatisfied with the first version, I took them down to redo the QR code and decided to give the initiative its own identity. I spent about a week around the holidays designing new posters with a refreshed, lively look that the existing system lacked. However, the lack of engagement with the QR codes made me realize that the familiarity and integration of the Be the Key System were its strengths. Instead of creating a new concept and branding for a digital gratitude system, I decided to build on the existing system to support, grow, and improve it, rather than confusing the nurses with another system.

\-Types of Messages



During the initiative, I observed a variety of messages in the notes. One manager mentioned their goal of sending more keys than the previous year, which can be challenging given their busy schedules. Consequently, managers' notes were often shorter and less detailed compared to those from nurses and staff. Survey responses also indicated a desire for more meaningful key distribution. I wanted to address this without diminishing the appreciation managers provide. This led me to consider emphasizing the quality of keys over quantity, and whether public recognition should highlight exceptional stories or offer frequent glimpses of everyone's contributions.



Survey: 



At the start of the initiative, I sent out two pre-surveys. The first aimed to understand how expressions of gratitude from colleagues and supervisors impact nurses' morale, mental health, and job longevity (8 responses). The second focused on current gratitude initiatives, like the Be the Key System, assessing engagement, usability, interface design, and overall convenience (27 responses). Key Findings are illustrated below. 



Thoughtful comments are just as important as a monetary reward. Especially from leadership.



Many users indicate their lack of awareness/education about the current system. 



Users like accessing the keys through the digital library.



Inclusivity is important
